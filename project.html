    <table align="center" style="max-width:700px; color:#959595; word-wrap: break-word; border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FFFFFF; padding: 1em;">
      <td style="text-align:center"> This project idea involves using virtual reality technology and incorporating it into the movie industry, this would involve a massive overhaul in the
        way the movie industry currently functions and the way movies are filmed and created would need to be re-imagined. The way the project works is the user will put on a VR headset while
        watching a movie, this will allow the user to walk around a movie scene and view the movie from multiple points of view.

    <table align="center" style="max-width:700px; color:#959595; word-wrap: break-word; border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FFFFFF; padding: 1em;">
      <td style="text-align:center"> I believe this project would generate a large amount of interest within the entertainment sector and give a new perspective to all movie watchers. There is a
        large amount of money generated from the movie industry and since developments like 3D people have been waiting for the next big thing, I believe VR movies are that next big thing.
        In the gaming industry VR has had success, VR has opened a new set of opportunities giving new experiences to gamers, this proven success within the gaming industry tells me that there
        would be a demand for this product within the movie industry.

    <h2 style="color:#959595">Description</h2>
    <table align="center" style="max-width:700px; color:#959595; word-wrap: break-word; border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FFFFFF; padding: 1em;">
      <td style="text-align:center"> This product will use a googles headset that would go over the users head and use trackers to account for all the users movements, this gives the user full view
        of an open environment based in the movie. A controller may need to be included to incorporate movement within the movie environment. The design of the controller would need to be small
        and lightweight since the user will be holding them for an extended period, wireless controllers will also be integrated to allow the most freedom for the user, these controllers will
        incorporate motion technology meaning that the user will be able to move the controller around and their hand within the movie will follow. The user will have the same freedom as they
        would while watching a normal movie, they will be able to pause, reward fast-forward and even record the character they are role playing within the movie and play it back.<br>
      </br>Initially his product would be in-house only, since the cost of the device and space needed for it to function is would not be feasible to set up for multiple occupants within a movie theatre,
        the user will be able to movie around a virtually generated environment and view a movie with a different perspective. The user could also interact with the movie and influence the outcome of
        the movie, thus making the user a character within the movie.<br>
        </br>Obtaining media for this product in the early stages will be quite difficult, since it will be a new technology it will take movie producers a period of time before they start to make movies
        suitable for VR viewing. The VR headset will be able to watch physical copies of movies as well as digital downloaded versions. Streaming services such as Netflix or Stan could also provide VR
        movies in the future making it even more assessable for the user, higher download speeds may be required in order to stream a VR movie.<br>
        </br>The VR headset will need to be connected to an external computer source, this gives the headset features such as motion tracking, high resolution and the best graphics possible for the best
        viewing experience, wireless connection technology would be incorporated to give the user the upmost freedom while using the product. <br>
        </br>Since the user will be wearing the headset for an extended period the headset will be designed with comfort in mind, this means reducing the weight and size of the device is necessary to give
        the user a good experience with the product. The shell of the device would be made out out of a lightweight plastic or carbon fibre. Padding would also be incorporated to further increase
        of overall comfort, considerations will be made in relation to the design of the headset in order to reduce the effects of motion sickness.

      <td style="text-align:center"> Virtual reality headset - While watching a virtual reality movie a VR headset would be required, this is a headset that goes over your eyes, this then displays an
        image to the viewer. A VR headset is used to immerse a user in a virtual reality experience, the VR headset tracks the users head movements and displays an environment accordingly making them
        feel like they within the environment. Hand controllers will also be used to give the user movement and interaction within the virtual environment. <br>
        </br>360-degree camera technologies – 360-degree cameras would be needed to capture live-action footage.<br>
        </br>Movie creation software – This would be for animated movies, there are a large assortment of software’s that could be used to make a movie that would be suitable for virtual reality viewing.

        <div style="text-align:left">
          <p>• Virtual reality headset is required to test elements of the project and view media created.</p>
          <p>• A vast knowledge of how virtual reality works and how to operate a VR headset is needed to effectively operate.</p>
          <p>• Knowledge of what’s required to produce a movie either live-action and animated is required to have media to aid the project.</p>
          <p>• 360-degree cameras are required to capture 360-degree media for the virtual reality technology.</p>
          <p>• Knowledge of operating a 360-degree camera.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align:center; position:relative;">The hardware mentioned above can be mostly acquired using funds, the virtual reality headsets can be purchased and hardware like 360-degree camera can be rented. The skills can be easily
          acquired by hiring professionals with experience in film making and animation and any software can be purchased.</div>

        If this project were to become successful it would result in a new entertainment genre being created within the movie industry, it would result in larger revenue entering the movie industry
        and the movie industry being more successful as a result. On the other hand, since this project would mostly be a in house entertainment tool it could result in movie theatres becoming less
        used by the public resulting in potential closing down. This project would rejuvenate the movie industry and give it a new lease of life and intimately have a positive impact on any users
        looking for a new movie watching experience.
