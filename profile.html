          <td style="text-align:center"> I became interested in Information Technology from a young age, growing up throughout the 90’s to now I have witness vast
            improvements within the IT industry is such a short time. These vast developments have excited me throughout my life and I
            would really love to be apart of the industry and to try to put my own stamp on the future development of IT. My previous
            experiences in IT include just day to day tinkering with my devices, from building my own computer, helping family and friends
            with their IT problems or trying to replace my cracked phone screen (for the 5th time). I also have a clear grasp with programming
            and am efficient with C#, Java, and SQL server, although I am always trying to improve.<br>
            </br>I chose to come to RMIT University to start and complete my Bachelor of Information Technology, my reasoning for this choice is
            because I wanted to delve into the world of IT and expand from just programming, I wanted to challenge myself and I believe that
            RMIT that has one of the best IT courses that any of the Australian universities can offer. So far, I am really enjoying the content
            of the course, I am eager to learn new things and develop my skills with all things IT.<br>
            </br>Throughout my studies I expect to be given the knowledge and background required to become an efficient attribute within the IT
            industry, I want to develop my programming skills and hardware skills. I also want to develop some skills that may not directly be
            related to IT, this includes my team working skills, my presentations skills and my overall communication skills.</td>

            <td style="text-align:center"> I partook in three tests to get a self-evaluation of what traits I possess, the tests include a Myers-Briggs Test, a Learning
              Style Test and a Big Five Personality Test. The results from the selected tests told me a few things about myself.<br>
              </br>
              <h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
              I got an ENTJ result which means that I have an Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Judging personality, this means that I have higher level of charisma
              and confidence and have leadership qualities. I will use my drive and determination to achieve which ever goal is set for me.<br>
              </br>
              <h3>Learning Styles Test</h3>
              I got a result of 45% as a visual learner, 35% tactile and 20% Auditory, this means that I am predominately a visual learner, I prefer to drop my books and
              learn while watching. This result makes a lot of sense to me, as I have always thought of myself as a visual learner.<br>
              </br>
              <h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3>
              I got a results telling me that I am low range in my openness to exposure telling me that I am down to earth and practical, I am middle range in
              conscientiousness which means that I am not the most productive person but still not disorganised, I have a middle range in Extraversion which means
              there are times where I enjoy being by myself and times where I enjoy being with others, I have a low range in Agreeableness meaning I am competitive
              and hard headed and I have a very low range in Natural reactions meaning I am very relaxed most of the time.

              <h3>Team Behaviour</h3>
              The information gathered about myself lead me to the conclusion that my behaviour may influence a team environment, Myers-Briggs test has told me that
              I have leadership qualities and a high charisma and confidence, although I may be fit to be a leader of a group I like to let everyone have some form of
              leadership within a group. My learning styles test told me that any task that involves visual aspect should be delegated to me to complete. The Big five
              personality test has told me that while I am down to earth and practical, there is also a side to me that struggles to agree with ideas that I think are wrong.<br>
              </br>
              <h3>Forming a Team</h3>
              When forming a team, I should use the information collected from the tests to influence my team’s strategy to suit myself and suit my other team members,
              this could include nominating myself for a leadership role within the group and nominating myself to partake in any aspects of the project that would suit
              a visual learner. My personality allows me to work as part of a team or individually, this is a big plus when forming a team as both would be required to
              finish tasks and my competitive aspects would influence the overall productivity of the group.
